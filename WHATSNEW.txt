Here is a list of some known unresolved issues. If an issue has JIRA ID [OP-XXX],
you may track it using the following URL: http://bugs.openpilot.org/browse/OP-XXX

+ Only French translation is updated, use English for other locales or help with translations.
+ Radio Wizard confused by a reversed throttle, fix it on your transmitter before starting wizard.
+ Radio Wizard Throttle display does not show full range properly.
+ [Windows 8] USB Driver is broken.
+ Firmware Update Instructions on Firmware Tab not entirely accurate for all upgrade paths.
+ Tricopter's using Vehicle Wizard need to check servo does not need reversed manually.
+ XAircraft ESCs uses non-standard PPM range which may cause issues with Vehicle Wizard.
+ Spectrum Satellite Receivers setup in Radio Wizard may have wrong protocol set.
+ Old Intel 965 have an OpenGL bug that turns the QML PFD black and while.
+ [OP-732] Import UAV Settings for inactive modules crashes the running firmware (board restarts).
           Workaround: update firmware, power cycle, enable modules, power cycle, import configuration.
+ [OP-747] Board infinitely reboots itself after firmware upgrade (settings erase firmware is a workaround).
+ [OP-723] GCS uses the system language ot the 1st run. After restart it uses English (can be changed later).
+ [OP-725] GCS camera stab config error message disappears too fast (but config error is cleared as it should)
+ [OP-767] GCS does not send AttitudeActual packets over serial port when GPS is connected and system is armed
+ [OP-768] GCS does not show UAV position on the map (master or next CC branches, but works in Revo branches)
+ [OP-769] Can't enter "12,45" on German system. Workaround: change GCS language (in fact, locale) to German.

2012-11-12
Implemented smoothing filter for accelerometer data.
Added support for Mode 3 and Mode 4 to the TX Configuration Wizard.

--- RELEASE-12.10.1 ---

2012-10-26
Temporary disabled AutoTune GCS GUI. It was listed as an experimental
feature in the previous release, there were however a few cases where
it did not behave as expected.

--- RELEASE-12.10 ---

2012-10-06
Receiver port can now be configured as PPM *and* PWM inputs.
Pin 1 is PPM, other pins are PWM inputs.

2012-07-27
Added the ability to load stylesheets from external file according to operating system:
macos.qss, linux.qss, windows.qss
Files should be placed inside the app folder.

2012-07-27
Several UI changes. 
MixerCurveWidget refactoring, now as a simple and advanced view.

2012-07-27
Added "advanced mode" option to general settings. Right now it only shows the hidden apply buttons.
To enable go to tools->options->General and click one of the checkboxes to give focus to the form,
then press F7

2012-07-27
Made the flight mode switch and accessory pots move according to user input on the input wizard.

2012-07-27
Changed the board pictures on the uploader widget

2012-07-27
Add more verbose debug output on the UAVOBJECTS saving code.

2012-08-11
CopterControl can now emulate an 8-channel USB HID joystick.  Primarily,
this lets you use any RC transmitter with flight simulators on your PC.

2012-07-20
AeroSimRC simulator plugin is now included into the Windows distribution
(will be installed into .../OpenPilot/misc/AeroSIM-RC directory).  Still
being an experimental development tool, it could be used to play with
HITL version 2.  Other platforms include udp_test utility which can be
used to check the connectivity with AeroSimRC plugin running on Windows
machine.

2012-07-10
On Windows the installation mode was changed from per-user to per-machine
(for all users) installation.  It is recommended to completely uninstall
previous version before installing new one to remove per-user installed
files.  Per-machine installation requires elevated (administrator) previleges
during install.  But since the same rights are now required to install
optional CDC driver (virtual communication port), it was deemed acceptable.

2012-06-04
AeroSimRC support merged into next

2012-05-26
VirtualFlybar which allows a more aggressive flight mode than rate mode
support.  Also PiroCompensation added.

2012-05-26
Revert some UI changes that didn't work consistently between OSX and Windows.

2012-05-24
Merged the updated firmware for the PipXtreme, thanks to Brian for a lot of
work on this.

2012-05-04
Support for CC3D.  This involved changes to various things such as the sensors
being split from AttitudeRaw to Accels,Gyros,Magnetometer.  A single firmware
image fw_coptercontrol will run on both CC and CC3D.  When compiling the
bootloader one must set the HW_REVISION to the appropriate value.  0x01 is for
CC and 0x02 is for CC3D.  If the wrong bootloader is installed the firmware
will not run.

2012-05-02
Reduction in the memory usage due to the UAVObject metadata.  Now the update
periods are using a smaller data type and the various flags relating to access
controls and update modes are stored in a bitfield.  The UAVObjectBrowser has
not been updated to allow these modes to be easily changed.

2012-03-31
Support for ground vehicle configuration has been added to the the GCS.

2012-02-14
New QML based system to allow more flexible UI.  Upgraded stabilization
configuration.

2012-01-02
CC FW now supports USB Virtual Com Port (VCP/CDC) in addition to the original HID interface
New ComUsbBridge module can bridge any serial port to the USB CDC port
CC FW now detects repeated faults during init and boots with default hwsettings

2012-01-02
Added new camera stabilization features: AxisLock mode and LPF.

2011-12-10
Merged a change that sorts the UAVO fields based on size.  Because this changes
all of the objects, erase all existing flash files based on this.

2011-11-04
New Spektrum/JR satellite receiver driver implementation.
It now provides explicit selection of DSM2 (and DSMJ), DSMX (10bit) and
DSMX (11bit) serial protocol variations to better serve different frame
and resolution modes. The protocol name used now is DSM instead of
previously used Spektrum to make it less ambiguous when used with JR
2.4GHz radios.

2011-10-20
Inputs can be remapped to outputs to allow up to 10 channels of control.  The
receiver inputs remap as follows:
Receiver 3 because output channel 7
Receiver 4 because output channel 8
Receiver 5 because output channel 9
Receiver 6 because output channel 10

2011-10-11
Fix for the Mac telemetry rates and specifically how long enumeration took.

2011-10-08
Make the flash chip need to be have bad magic for a full second before erasing
settings.  Should avoid random lost settings.

2011-09-12
Max rate now ONLY applies to attitude and axis lock mode.  Manual rate is the
only term that limits the rate mode now (and in axis lock when you push stick
only manual rate applies).  Also integrals are reset when unused.

2011-09-09
Some large updates to the input system.  Now multiple receivers can be
connected at once.  A wizard was added for configuring the input channels.  A
specific collective pitch channel was added.

2011-09-04
Improvements to the failsafe handling code for inputs.  PWM power off is now
detected properly.  Powering on transmitter for Spektrum Satellite no longer
causes a glitch on servos.

2011-08-10
Added Camera Stabilization and a gui to configure this.  This is a software
selectable module from the GUI.  However, a restart is required to make it
active.  The GUI does not currently expose the configuration for using the
transmitter to change the view angle but this is supported by the hardware.

2011-08-10
By default a lot of diagnostic objects that were enabled by default are now
disabled in the build.  This include TaskInfo (and all the FreeRTOS options
that provide that debugging information).  Also MixerStatus, I2CStatus,
WatchdogStatus and RateDesired.  These can be reenabled for debugging with
-DDIAG_ALL.

2011-08-04
Fixed packaging aesthetic issues.  Also avoid runtime issues on OSX Lion by
disabling the ModelView and Notify plugins for now (sorry).

2011-07-29
Added support for PPM receivers from James W. Now all 4 interfaces (R/C
standard PWM, combined PPM (MK), Spektrum satellite, Futaba S.Bus) are
supported and configurable through the GCS hardware configuration tab.

2011-07-17
Updated module initialization from Mathieu which separates the initialization
from the task startup.  Also implements a method to reclaim unused ram from
initialization and end of memory for the FreeRTOS heap.

2011-07-12
Improvements to the stabilization code.  Included a LPF on the gyros to smooth
out noise in high vibration environments.  Also two new modes: axis-lock and
weak leveling.  Axis-lock will try and hold an axis at a fixed position and
reject any disturbances.  This is like heading-hold on a heli for the tail but
can be useful for other axes.  Weak leveling is rate mode with a weak
correction to self level the craft - good for easier rate mode flying.

2011-07-07
Dynamic hardware configuration from Stac.  The input type is now
selected from ManualControlSettings.InputMode and the aircraft must be rebooted
after changing this.  Also for CopterControl the HwSettings object must
indicate which modules are connected to which ports.  PPM currently not
working.
