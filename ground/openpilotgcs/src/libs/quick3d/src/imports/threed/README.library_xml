The library.xml file is required to get syntax highlighting of Qt3D 
plugin items in Qt Creator < version 2.2.

The library.xml file is installed into the imports/Qt3D tree along with
the plugin and the qmldir file.

When any of the elements - property names, class names or other exports
- in the Qt3D plugin are changed this file will need to be regenerated.

To generate the library.xml file see the scripts/README file for a
description of how to use the filter-qmldump.pl script.

This is a less-than-optimal solution but as syntax discovery improves
in Qt Creator better solutions should become available at which time
this temporary script and syntax file may be deprecated.
