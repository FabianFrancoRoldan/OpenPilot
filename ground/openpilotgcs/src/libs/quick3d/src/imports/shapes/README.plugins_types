The plugins.qmltypes file is required to get syntax highlighting of Qt3D.Shapes
plugin items inside Qt Creator 2.2 and later.

To support earlier versions of Qt Creator the library.xml file is used.

The plugins.qmltypes file is installed into the imports/Qt3D.Shapes tree along
with the plugin and the qmldir file.

When any of the elements - property names, class names or other exports
- in the Qt3D.Shapes plugin are changed this file will need to be regenerated.

To generate the plugins.qmltypes, you first need a qmldump binary generated from
sources shipped with Qt Creator 2.2 or greater.  On Mac these are inside the app
bundle, other platforms vary.  If all else fails get the sources from the Qt
Creator repo.

To build qmldump you need access to private headers, so therefore it must be
built against a source build of Qt.  On Mac it is helpful to build qmldump with
"qmake CONFIG-=app_bundle" so that you get a regular command-line binary.

Once you finally have a viable qmldump binary:

./qmldump Qt3D.Shapes 1.0 $QTDIR/imports > plugins.qmltypes

...where $QTDIR points to the root of the Qt where Qt3D is installed.

If you get a usage error like:

Usage: qmldump [plugin/import/path plugin.uri]

...then the version of qmldump source you used was not for Qt Creator > 2.2 -
you somehow have the earlier version qmldump sources.

You do not need to use the filter-qmldump.pl script.
