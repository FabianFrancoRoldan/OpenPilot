This directory contains miscellaneous utility scripts for use with Qt3D.

filter-qmldump.pl
=================

Use this script to regenerate the library.xml files after making changes
to the properties or structure of the QML bindings.

It expects a file called "library.xml" to be in the current directory, and
requires a single command line argument, which is a string matching the 
module name to filter on.

Typical use:

1) Build and install Qt3D into a given Qt at $QTDIR
2) Ensure qmldump is available in your $PATH (see below)
3) Run qmldump to generate the library.xml file:
   qmldump $QTDIR/imports Qt3D > library.xml
4) Filter the output to just include the Qt3D module:
   filter-qmldump.pl Qt3D > library-qt3d.xml

Repeat 3) & 4) for the Shapes library:
   qmldump $QTDIR/imports/Shapes Qt3D.Shapes > library.xml
   filter-qmldump.pl Qt3D > library-qt3d.xml

To generate the plugins.qmltypes, you first need a qmldump binary generated from
sources shipped with Qt Creator version less than 2.2.  On Mac these are inside
the app bundle, other platforms vary.  If all else fails get the sources from the
Qt Creator repo.

To build qmldump you need access to private headers, so therefore it must be
built against a source build of Qt.  On Mac it is helpful to build qmldump with
"qmake CONFIG-=app_bundle" so that you get a regular command-line binary.

In the above note that $QTDIR points to the root of the Qt where Qt3D is installed.

Check the contents of library.xml above and ensure it is XML - not yaml.  If you
see some curly braces { } - then the version of qmldump source you used was for
Qt Creator > 2.2 - you somehow have the later version qmldump sources.
